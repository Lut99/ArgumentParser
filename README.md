# Lut99's ArgumentParser
## About
Lut99's ArgumentParser is a C++ class which aims to allow the programmer to parse CLI-arguments with the least effort possible. Using modern C++, the ArgumentParser takes care of reading the input, converting input to C++-datatypes and resolving argument dependencies that the programmer might like to add. Additionally, the Parser can automatically generate help and usage texts.

## Notice
The repository may feel rather empty now, but as soon as version 1.0.0 is released, we will create a detailed WIKI and update this README.md to become much more informative. In short, stay tuned for more information!
